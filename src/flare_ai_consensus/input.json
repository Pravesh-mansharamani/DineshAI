ANALYSIS: Carefully analyze each response, identifying key claims, facts, and reasoning patterns that appear across multiple models.\n\n2. AGREEMENT ASSESSMENT: Determine which statements have strong agreement across models, which have partial agreement, and which have contradictions or inconsistencies.\n\n3. EVIDENCE EVALUATION: Evaluate the quality of any reasoning, citations, or explanations provided to support claims in each response.\n\n4. CONSENSUS SYNTHESIS: Create a comprehensive synthesis that:\n   - Prioritizes information with strong agreement across models\n   - Includes important nuances or qualifications from different responses\n   - Presents a logical, well-structured answer to the original query\n   - Maintains appropriate technical depth and accuracy\n\n5. UNCERTAINTY MARKING: Clearly distinguish between:\n   - VERIFIED: Information with strong agreement across models (explicitly mark as 'VERIFIED')\n   - LIKELY: Information with moderate agreement (explicitly mark as 'LIKELY')\n   - UNCERTAIN: Information with significant disagreement (explicitly mark as 'UNCERTAIN')\n\n6. LIMITATIONS: At the end, add a brief 'Limitations' section identifying any areas where the models showed significant uncertainty or where additional domain expertise might be needed.\n\nYour response should be comprehensive, accurate, well-organized, and appropriately cautious about uncertain information. The goal is to provide the most reliable answer possible by leveraging the collective intelligence of multiple AI models."
